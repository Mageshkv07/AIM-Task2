# AIM-Task2
# üß† Pok√©mon Data Exploration and Visualization

## üéØ Objective
To understand the Pok√©mon dataset using **statistics** and **visualizations**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
- **Pandas** ‚Äì for data manipulation and summary statistics  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì for basic and statistical visualizations  
- **Plotly** ‚Äì for interactive exploration

## üìä Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Summary Statistics
We used `df.describe()` to generate:
- Mean, Median, Standard Deviation
- Min, Max, and Quartiles

This helped us understand the spread and central tendencies of numeric features like `HP`, `Attack`, `Defense`, etc.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Distribution Analysis

#### ‚úÖ **Histogram**
We created histograms (e.g., for `HP`) to visualize the frequency distribution of numerical values.

#### ‚úÖ **Boxplot**
Boxplots for key features (`HP`, `Attack`, `Defense`, `Speed`) revealed:
- Range
- Median
- Outliers
- Skewness

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Relationship Between Features

#### ‚úÖ **Pairplot (Seaborn)**
Pairplot helped us understand pairwise relationships among numeric stats.  
For example: the relationship between `Attack` and `Defense`.

#### ‚úÖ **Correlation Heatmap**
We used a heatmap to visualize:
- How strongly features correlate
- E.g., `Attack` and `Speed` may not always correlate, while `Sp. Atk` and `Sp. Def` might

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Trend & Pattern Discovery

#### ‚úÖ **Plotly Interactive Scatter Plot**
We extracted the `attack` and `defense` values from the nested `Stats` column and plotted them:

- X-axis: `Attack`  
- Y-axis: `Defense`  
- Color: `Type`  
- Hover: Pok√©mon `Name`

This allowed us to:
- Detect clusters of Pok√©mon with similar stats
- Notice extremes (very high Attack or very low Defense)
- Compare Pok√©mon types

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Inferences from Visuals

From the plots, we can infer:
- Some types (like Dragon or Fighting) are skewed toward high `Attack`
- Outliers exist with unusually high `Defense` or `Speed`
- A few Pok√©mon balance both `Attack` and `Defense`, while others trade one off for the other

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

We successfully:
- Explored the dataset statistically
- Visualized distributions and relationships
- Identified patterns and potential anomalies
- Gained insights from visual storytelling
